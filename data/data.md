# 01-02-00 Modern road design
**source**
W 1.1 Introduction to Road Engineering, page 6
**content**
The process of designing and managing the safe and efficient movement of people and goods on the road network. The key points are to design and manage the road network. It is a tradeoff between the needs to develop the network that is safe but also efficient. These can often be competing demands, particularly when we discuss travel speed. We also need to consider the movement of not only poeple but also ranges of goods on the road network. In particular, we need to consider the range of vehicles, from bicycles, motorcycles, private cars, through the large vehicles.

# 01-03-00 Road design process
**source**
W 1.1 Introduction to Road Engineering, page 7
**content**
Road design is only one component of the transportation engineering system. From diagram [image/01-03-00 Road design process.jpg], the focuses of this unit, mostly, are Geometric and Pavements Design. We will touch a little of Drainage and Structures. We will also briefly consider some of the other elements in this framework.

# 01-04-00 Benefits of a good road network
**source**
W 1.1 Introduction to Road Engineering, page 8
**content**
Why do we need to plan our road network？There are many benefits associated with the developing road network that operates efficiently and allow people and goods to move freely. The 
- The road network can provide easy access to commercial, retail and recreational activities.
- This can stimulate economic growth.
- When designed well, the road network can improve safety, access and efficiency.
- Thus to improve road freight productivity.
- And improve public transport operating conditions.

# 01-05-00 Road design considerations
**source**
W 1.1 Introduction to Road Engineering, page 9
**content**
In order to develop a good road network, we need to make sure we take into account key road design considerations.
- three key things of road design: Safety, efficiency and accessibility issues for road users. We need to make tradeoffs between these three sometime competing needs. For example, it may be more efficient to let vehicles travel at higher speed. This can have safety issues because crashes that occur at higher speed are likely to cause more severe injuries. At the same time, it may not be practical to provide adjacent land use if travel speed is set too high.
- Performance and types of vehicles (traffic). Design not just for cars, but also for large truck and small or more vulnerable road users such as bicycles.
- Behaviour of road users. To understand human factors and how they need to be consider. 
- Geometry of the road and limitations (vertical and horizontal profile of the road). 
- Impact of road on environment
- Economics – road cost/efficiency, economic benefits associated with construction and management

# 01-06-00 Road context in Road traffic design system
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 5
**content**
 Road is not isolated from the rest of the world. And often, the road design decisions are influenced by range of other factors including political, institutional, and planning considerations. These factors need to be considered in almost every road design projects.
 When we look at road design, some of the key considerations include:
 - How much is spent
 - What gets done, and where,
 - Who designs and builds the road project.

 These considerations are determined by:
 - Political process (safety, environmental and social impacts & election)
 - Institutional factors (set up by politicians to build and design roads)
 - Planning process (not designed to give one result that must be followed)

 These factors may not be very technical. But in practice, senior engineers might spend much of their time working on this.

# 01-07-00 Classification of roads
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 6
**content**
Road networks fulfill four basic functions: 
- Caters for moving passenger and freight traffic,
- Caters for parked vehicles,
- Caters for pedestrians and non-vehicular traffic and
- Allows development and access to adjacent land use.

This functions are inconsistent and competing. For example, a road suit for carrying large volumne of traffic may not be suited for pedestrians or providing convenient access. Thus, it is necessary to have various types of road, each serving predominent functions.

# 01-08-00 Road functions
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 7
**content**
Roads have two main functions: movement and access.
Movement involves the movement of people or goods.
Access sometimes refers to activity that looks for other functions that the road might facilitate such as providing access to shops, houses, parking, or other facilites in the road reserve.

# 01-09-00 Road hierarchies and functional classification
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 8-9
**content**
Based on the two basic funcions of road, Movement & Access, the diagram [image/02-04-00 Road hierarchies.jpg] shows the classification based on movement v.s. access function. Here is the more detailed description of each range of different road types.
- Freeway:Those roads with full access control and grade separated instructions, whose primary function is to service large traffic movements.
- Primary Arterials: Those arterial roads whose function is to form the principle avenue for communication for metropolitan traffic movementsnot catered by for freeways.
- Secondary Arterials: Those roads which supplement the primary arterial roads in providing for through traffic movement, to an individually determined limit that is sensitive to both roadway characteristics and abutting land uses.
- Collector Roads: Those non-arterial roads which distribute traffic between the arterial roads and the local street system which provide local connection between arterial roads and which provide accessto abutting property.
- Local Access Streets: Those streets not being arterials or collectors whose main function is to provide accessto abutting property.

# 01-10-00 Other road classifications
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 11
**content**
Two other consideration for classifying roads:
- Administration (who is responsible for the road)
  - State Goverment (major roads), e.g., major roads/freeways in Victoria state
  - Local Goverment (local roads) fund and maintained by local councils
- Funding
  - Federal funds portion of roads of “major economic benefit” (major projects, e.g., a new freeway)
  - State covers the rest of funding of major roads
  - Local government / developers fund local roads

# 01-11-00 brief introduction of design components
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 13
**content**
There are three components in road design: humans, vehicles, and road itself. The characteristics impact the design. There are two critical issues: Range of characteristics & The operating (traffic) environment.
Looking at range of characteristics, road design involves the standard input values, such as: driver eye height, vehicle performance, speed, and reaction time. These are given in design manuals. However, in reality, none of the characteristics is a single fixed value. And all of them distributed across ranges of values. Clearly, we should not design for the average condition, which leaves half of population fail. However, on the other hand, we typically do not design for 100% of the population, which will cause overdesign. For instance, for driver eye height, it is very uncommon that someone drive in a low sport car travelling at a very high speed and have incrediblly short reaction time and brake distance. So, it is not necessary to use all extreme values. Therefore, use 85th percentile values in general design. 
The other system input is to realise the road vehicle driver system must be capable of operating in a range of environmental conditions. The enviroment in which traffic movemnet occurs has an important affect of both design and operation of the traffic system. It includes a range of physical, traffic, and social environment. The following table shows the factors: 
| Operating environment | Factors |
|---|---|
| Physical environment | day and night (light conditions), the terrain, weather conditions, abutting development (construction cost and standard to use) |
| Traffic environment | traffic flow (daily and hourly), directional split, traffic composition, seasonality of traffic demands (e.g., recreational locations) |
| Social environment | driver's understanding of regulations (e.g., the system should run under consistent rules), community attitudes to driver responsibility, degree of enforcement by police |

# 01-12-00 brief overview of design process
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 17
**content**
The objectives of design process are: Safety, Efficiency, and Amenity. We can call it SEA.
Safety: involves providing a safe facility for both users and society as a whole. It should always be checked
Efficiency: related to the cost of providing, maintaining, and using the road. e.g., If we were to design a bypass of a rural town, the efficiency objetive must ensure the cost building and maintaining the road, cost saving, travel time, running cost, and social & environmental cost of the project as such the project is efficient in use resources that can be used in other places.
Amenity: for both road users and non-road users.

# 01-13-00 brief overview of design stages
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 18
**content**
Here is a simple structure of a design project.
- Conceptual design (Phase 0)
  - Low details
  - Large number of alternatives
  - e.g., if we consider a highway bypass of a rural town. Alteratives with horizontal alignment and general design parameters such as design speed will be set. And each option will be evaluated at a general level
- Preliminary design (Phase 1)
  - Smaller number of options (3-6)
  - More detailed level
  - e.g., for the rural bypass, it may include horizontal and vertical profiles, road cross section, and others... Each option will be evaluated to assess economical, social, and environmental viability and recommendation may be for small or one alternatives to go to the next stage, the detailed design.
- Detailed/Final design (Phase 2)
  - Suitable level of design details for construction purposes
  - e.g., for the bypass example, the geometry, cross section, and all, will be finalised. All elements will be ready for construction.


# 01-14-00 brief introduction of design elements
**source**
W 1.2 The Road Traffic Design System, page 20
**content**
design elements are the components of the physical road that require design. Here is the list: horizontal & vertical geometry, road reserve, traffic lanes, shoulders, roadside, road furniture, intersections, pavement, drainage.

# 01-15-00 National road safety strategy
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 8
**content**
National Road Safety Strategy 2011/2020
- No person should be killed or seriously injured on Australia’s roads
- Reduce the annual number of road crash fatalities by at least 30 per cent
- Reduce the annual number of serious road crash injuries by at least 30 per cent.
- The strategy embraces the Safe System approach to road safety improvement

# 01-16-00 brief introduction of Safe system approach
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 9
**content**
- Derived from Sweden’s ‘Vision Zero’ and the Dutch ‘Sustainable Safety’ approaches
- Crashes will continue to occur in spite of best efforts to prevent them (human error)
- Aims to eliminate fatal crashes and reduce serious injury crashes
- Safety interventions based on the best available scientific evidence of what is effective
- A shared responsibility:
  - Road users responsible for complying with system rules
  - System designers and operators responsible for the road-transport system

# 01-17-00 Safe system principles
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 10
**content**
When crashes do occur, crash energies need to reduce to levels that minimize the probability of death and serious injury
- Provision of a safe, crashworthy system that is forgiving of human error and accommodates vulnerability to serious injury
- Recognition that all aspects of the transport system work together
- Manage the road infrastructure, speeds, vehicles and road users and the interactions between these components to achieve safe mobility

# 01-18-00 key ideals of the Safe System approach
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 11
**content**
The Safe System approach aims to create a forgiving road system based on four key ideals:
- People make mistakes – and some crashes are inevitable.
- People are vulnerable –Our bodies have a limited ability to withstand crash forces without being seriously injured or killed.
- We need to share responsibility –System designers and people who use the roads must all share responsibility for creating a road system where crash forces do not result in death or serious injury.
- We need to strengthen all parts of the system – We need to improve the safety of all parts of the system – roads and roadsides, speeds, vehicles, and road use so that if one part fails, other parts will still protect the people involved.

# 01-19-00 Components of the Safe System
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 16
**content**
As the diagram [image/01-19-00 Components of the Safe System.jpg]，there are four components of the "SAFE SYSTEM":
- Safe roads – that are predictable and forgiving of mistakes. They are self-explaining in that their design encourages safe travel speeds (road factor).
- Safe speeds – travel speeds suit the function and level of safety of the road. People understand and comply with the speed limits and drive to the conditions (speed factor).
- Safe vehicles – that prevent crashes and protect road users, including pedestrians and cyclists, in the event of a crash (vehicle factor).
- Safe road use – road users that are skilled and competent, alert and unimpaired. They comply with road rules, take steps to improve safety, and demand and expect safety improvements (driver or rider factor).

# 01-20-00 Design safe system must consider vulnerable road users
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 17
**content**
A transport system which aspires to achieve Safe System objectives cannot ignore: The vulnerability of some road user groups (a major determinant of injury outcome) 
Any safe system needs to be designed to protect our most vulnerable: Pedestrians, Cyclists, Motorcyclists, Children, The elderly.

# 01-21-00 Speed factor
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 19 & 20
**content**
In a 60km/h zone, travelling at:
- 65 km/h, you are twiceas likely to have a serious crashthan if you drive at 60 km/h
- 70 km/h, fourtimes
- 75 km/h, tentimes
- 80 km/h, 32 times
Vehicle speed is the crucial safety issue for vulnerable road users: Speed is an even more powerful determinant of injury severity in the event of a collision.

# 01-22-00 Speed management
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 21
**content**
Historically, the emphasis has been on mobility
- that is, we strive for the highest mobility until safety is compromised “too much” (may impact the level of road)
- current speed limits and road design tend to favour high mobility often at the expense of safety
- is this the balance we want?
In general, Australian urban speed limits are 10 km/h higher than in other Western countries
- However, speeds should be at levels that do not exceed human tolerance to violent forces

# 01-23-00 Speed choice factors
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 22
**content**
Factors that impact the choice of driver speed include: Driver factors, road & traffic factors, speed zone, crash & injury risk, police enforcement, education & publicity & promotion, and vehicle factors.

# 01-24-00 Speed limits
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 23
**content**
- Speed limits, arguably, have the single largest influence on driver/rider choice of speed.
- Studies consistently show that crash incidence or crash severity decline whenever speed limits have been reduced
  - After 50 km/h introduced in local streets in Victoria, pedestrian casualty crashes fell by 20% and pedestrian serious casualty crashes by 45%
  - Freeway speed limit reduced from 110km/h to 100km/h (Victoria, 1989) and resulted in a 19% drop in casualty crash rate on freeways
- Negligible time savings by driving faster

# 01-25-00 Driver or Rider factors
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 24
**content**
Drivers and riders:
- Are human and,therefore, make errors
- Consistently over-estimate what is a “safe” speed(poor risk perception)
- Are influenced by perceptions about risks of being “caught”
- Are concerned more about crash than injury risk
- Drive faster due to others around them -thus, a contagious effect
- Young drivers (less skilled) with young passengers travel faster than when alone
- Knowledge and attitudesabout speed only partly determine behaviour–other motives are often at play

# 01-26-00 The licensing system: entry to exit
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 25
**content**
Licensing systems are a key foundation in Australia road transport system in order to manage the driver/rider factors
Licensing systems can:
- Establish/assess entry level ability/skill
- Monitor maintenance of those skills
- Decide on continued fitness to drive
- Promote overall safe mobility of drivers
- Regulate who can drive
- Manage illegal driving (combined with enforcement, demerit and sanctions)

# 01-27-00 Vehicle factors
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 26
**content**
Even the best vehicles cannot protect their occupants in many common crash types.
“Safe” impact speeds generally fall below 30 to 50 km/h for:
- side-impacts at intersections
- collisions with trees and poles
- pedestrians and other vulnerable road users
- crashes between incompatible vehicle types
Low short-term potential for raising the level of “safe” impact speeds through improvements in crashworthiness.
It is probable that drivers over-estimate the protective capabilities of their vehicles.

# 01-28-00 Threshold impact speeds (human tolerance to violence)
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 27
**content**
Vehicles cannot protect us in high-speed crashes. The following table provides the threshold impact speeds (human tolerance to violence) under different conditions:
| Scenarios | Speed range |
|---|---|
| car/pedestrian | 20-30 km/h |
| car/motorcyclist | 20-30 km/h |
| car/tree or pole | 30-40 km/h |
| car/car (side-impact) | 50 km/h |
| car/car (head-on) | 70 km/h |

Estimated that if all drivers were in safer vehicles, we could achieve a 40% reduction in fatal crashes.

# 01-29-00 Road factors
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 30 & 31
**content**
Road features play a vital role in a driver/rider’s speed choice:
- Roadsides and the presence of trees, poles, etc.
- Intersections, and their design and operational features
- Alignment of roads and their design speeds
- Road surface condition
- "Road appearance" conditions: road width, number of lanes, roadside activity, divided/undivided, alignment (vertical and horizontal)

We can also involve the Traffic conditions (e.g., presence of other road users, general congestion or lack of congestion).

# 01-30-00 Roads and Roadsides
**source**
W 1.3 The Safe System Approach to Road Safety, page 32
**content**
Ways addressing high priority crashes types (high priority crash types typically involve incidents with a high risk of serious injury or death. Examples include fatal pedestrian crashes, single-vehicle frontal crashes with objects, and front-to-front or front-to-side collisions):
- Intersection design:
  - Adequate sight distance and speed reduction
  - Well designed roundabouts: low entry angle, good sight zone
- Separation and safer roadsides:
  - Separate motorcycle/bicycle lanes, footpaths
  - Use of good barrier systems
  - Major grade separation of railway crossings on arterials
